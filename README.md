# Hey there, I'm Marcos Lima! 👋

> A Computer Science student navigating the realms of code, creativity, and caffeine.

I'm a developer-in-training at the **Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel)**, passionate about building amazing things and exploring the stories hidden within bugs. My goal is to weave logic and imagination together, whether I'm writing C++ or crafting a poem.
